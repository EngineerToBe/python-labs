# Write a function called check_for_name that takes two strings as parameters named sentence and name. 
# The function should return True if name appears in sentence in all lowercase letters, all uppercase letters, or with any mix of uppercase and lowercase letters. 
# The function should return False otherwise.
# For example, the following three calls should all return True:

def check_for_name(sentence, name):
    if name.lower() in sentence.lower():
        return True
    else:
        return False


# Uncomment these function calls to test your function:
print(check_for_name("My name is Jamie", "Jamie"))
# should print True
print(check_for_name("My name is jamie", "Jamie"))
# should print True
print(check_for_name("My name is Samantha", "Jamie"))
# should print False
